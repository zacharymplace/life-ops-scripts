# ADR-001: Use ADR Format for Design Decisions

**Date:** 2025-08-24
**Status:** Accepted

---

## Context

We want a lightweight, consistent way to record design decisions for this project.
Tracking decisions makes it easier to onboard future contributors (including future Z$), review why choices were made, and ensure governance over time.

---

## Decision

We will use the **Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format** for all notable technical or process decisions.
ADRs will be stored in `docs/decisions/` and named sequentially: `ADR-XXX-title.md`.

---

## Consequences

- ‚úÖ Transparent record of design choices over time.
- ‚úÖ Easier to revisit/reverse decisions if needed.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires discipline to maintain ADRs as the project evolves.
- üîÑ Future ADRs may supersede earlier ones.

---

## Alternatives Considered

- **No formal process** ‚Üí Risk of losing context on decisions.
- **Heavyweight specs/docs** ‚Üí Too much overhead for a personal project.
